# About

## My Healing Philosophy

I believe that science and evidence-based practice have given the world amazing and powerful tools. I also believe that traditional, holistic, and indigenous practices have been diminished, disrespected, and underutilized in a for-profit healthcare system. There are many solutions and a combination of modalities that can best build the care a person needs. Every individual I work with will be considered as a whole person and we will build a collaborative relationship together and with your support networks. You will have my attention, my presence, and my witnessing, because that is the foundation of good care.

## My Offerings

### Whole Health Nutrition Assessment and Care Plan

The way we eat plays an essential role not just in how our bodies look and function, but in how we feel. Gut health is increasingly recognized as a component in chronic health conditions, pain and inflammation, and mental health. Our energy levels, our moods, our strength and mobility, and our ability to participate in life are all impacted by our nutrition. With this offering, we will collaborate on a comprehensive and holistic nutrition and health assessment, and I will help you identify how food choices as well as medications and supplements may be impacting your health. There are often simple changes that make a big difference in how we feel. I will take the time to explain the components of “food as medicine” and the gut microbiome and help you feel more empowered in making nutrition choices that are right for you.

### Medical Advocacy

As both a nurse and as a patient, I have experienced how difficult it can be to feel heard and seen in medical settings. I believe that patient advocacy is the most important priority of being a nurse. We often wait months to see a provider, then feel rushed or overwhelmed when we go to an appointment. One bad experience can make us feel like we will never get the care we need, and this is even more the case when we are dealing with complex or mysterious medical conditions. My goal is to listen to your concerns and symptoms and help you prepare for your visits so that you are able to identify your questions, needs, and whether or not a provider is the right fit for you. I will help you communicate with your providers and if you are local to Champaign-Urbana, I can also accompany you to visits and procedures. If you or a loved one is in the hospital, I can also be a presence and resource in navigating a confusing and often chaotic environment.

## Health Education

Part of being a healthcare provider is helping patients understand their medical conditions and the medications they are taking. We all should know how our bodies work and how to best take care of ourselves! Unfortunately, our profit-driven healthcare system is structured in a way that rarely leaves time for true education. In addition, while there are generalizations and averages with health, we also are each unique and complex. A “one size fits all” approach often leaves us feeling unheard and dismissed. No one should feel like they are alone in coming to understand what is going on with their health. My goal is to help you understand the way your body works, your medical conditions, the way your medications work or the side effects they may be causing, and identify further resources that will empower you. I offer one-on-one as well as group health education sessions.
