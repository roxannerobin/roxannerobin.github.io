/* Custom site styles
	 The theme's SCSS was being imported with a Liquid tag that resolves
	 to an empty string during the Pages build, causing the Sass error:
	 "File to import not found or unreadable:". Removing that import
	 prevents the build failure. Add any custom rules below.

/* Example: set a comfortable max-width for content */
body {
	font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial;
	line-height: 1.45;
